Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/project-2#project-feedback-evaluation) and check out some [examples](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/past-projects/project2&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1597596784944000&usg=AOvVaw1ihTzKFunxKsL2f6sIYdlC).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

1. Rock and roll jeopardy
2. Fake news categorizer
3. Virtual baseball cards/stats
4. Animal Crossing Critterpedia *<----- ... is the winner!*
* Disclaimer: I've stayed up way too late and forgot to do this until now😅 I may need to give this some more thought tomorrow. I was just spitballing here. These ideas are par-boiled AT BEST.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to have an account I can log into that stores the critters I've obtained in-game and makes my inventory browsable
* As a user, I want to be able to add or remove critters from my inventory
* As a user, I want to browse all the game's critters by name, category (fish, sea creature, bug), and availability (time of year and/or day)
