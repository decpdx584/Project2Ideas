### User Stories

* As a user, I want to have an account I can log into that stores the critters I've obtained in-game and makes my inventory browsable
* As a user, I want to be able to add or remove critters from my inventory
* As a user, I want to browse all the game's critters by name, category (fish, sea creature, bug), and availability (time of year and/or day)
